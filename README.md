# Play-Store-Apps-Analysis
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<h4>In this powerbi dashboard I have created, a playstore apps analysis is considered by different app, category, price, and version. The dashboard showcases key metrics such as the number of downloads, ratings, and reviews for each app, as well as the trend in app popularity over time. It also includes a breakdown of apps by category, such as games, productivity, and lifestyle, to understand the distribution of app offerings in the playstore. Additionally, it also allows for a comparison of app pricing and version releases, helping to identify patterns and trends in the playstore market. This provides valuable insights for app developers, marketers, and investors to make informed decisions.<h4>
